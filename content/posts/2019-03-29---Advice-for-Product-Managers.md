You need to have a clear understanding of why one product works, which customer segment is it targeting, what makes the product engaging — nearly all the successful products are used daily- both in B2B and B2C, marketplaces.

TECH Skills —

Server, Database, Frontend — understand how they work.
Understand the deployment phase — AWS etc. — It will help you to understand developers constraints.
APIs — APIs are widely used as in all the products for transfer of data across apps. You should understand how they work technically and their business aspect(a16z has a good video on it).
Resources —
